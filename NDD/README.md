#NDD
NDD: A Novel Method For Predicting Drug-Drug Interaction By Deep Neural Network
Due to the great importance of this issue in the economy, industry, and
health, proposing appropriate computational methods for predicting unknown
DDI with high precision is challenging. We propose a novel machine learning
method for predicting unknown DDIs called "NDD", using a two-layer fully
connected neural network. NDD uses various characteristics of drugs to have
comprehensive information. Multiple drug similarities are calculated. NDD integrat various drug similarities with a non-linear similarity fusion method called "SNF" to achieve high-level features.
